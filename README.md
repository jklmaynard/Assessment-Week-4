Some questions:

1. I began w/ a many-to-many relationship, but when I needed to add venue.ids[] to the "/bands/:id" patch, I wasn't sure if the many-to-many relationship would appear.  How does it get from the table? This is a question I intend to explore next week.

2. Ran into "unknown attribute error" on app.rb 15 trying to create validation method.  Couldn't manage to discover the solution.
